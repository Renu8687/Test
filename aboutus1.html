  <H2><B>FOUNDER'S VISION</B></H2>


<H3>Prof.(Dr.) Sunil Kumar</H3>
You are our Guiding Light.
Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow.
 
<p><b>(As a chariot cart cannot move with one wheel, similarly, without hard work destiny does not bring fruit.)</b>

The Sanskrit shloka beautifully captures the vision of Prof.(Dr.) Sunil Kumar, Founder, Lal Bahadur Shastri Group of Institutions. Who better than him could know the power of hard work. In 1982 when the seed of LBS Group was sown, probably nobody expected Prof. Kumar would turn into such a beautiful tree. And his belief was firmly rooted in his power to work hard to any extent with sincerity & commitment.

With quality as the core & excellence as the goal, the Group made continuous strides under his dynamic & visionary leadership. But, in this success journey, values & ethics were never given a backseat even if painful decisions had to be taken. That is what sets the LBS Group apart from the rest. This also is the underlying reason why Prof. Kumar was held in high esteem by the various parties in the Group’s external & internal environment– students, parents, faculty, contemporary institutions, PSUs, banks, private organisations, etc.

His approach towards his team can be summed up by the following shloka: 

<b>(The tree bears the intense heat on its head while it lessens the heat for those who take shelter under it.)</b>

Ever happy & smiling, he had the power to charge up the most dull employee. He could very quickly carry out the SWOT analysis of his employees & hand over responsibilities accordingly. For him mistake was not a crime but a lesson worth remembering but not repeating. Therefore, people would work without any stress, pressure or fear under his charismatic leadership.
